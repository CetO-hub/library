# library

Problem

Create a library app for books. The app should contain the author, title, number of pages and whether it’s been read or not. Books can be added and deleted from the app. There should also be the function for toggling between the states if the book has been read or not.

Plan

Data in entered upon clicking the "add button" in the UI via a form containing the following: author, title, number of pages and whether it’s been read or not.
As soon as the form is confirmed the data entered is displayed on the board. Each entry is a single card with the respective information. Each card has a "delete" button and a button to switch from read to unread modus and vice versa.
